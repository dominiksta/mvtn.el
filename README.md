# mvtn - "Minimum Viable Text Notes"

**WARNING**: This package is yet to be tested thouroughly and is still subject
to breaking changes. Do NOT expect stability just yet. A first release is
probably done soon enough though.

Mvtn is a plain-text note taking system for emacs. The primary guiding principle
is simplicity. The core of mvtn should *always* remain independent of add-on
code and less then 500 LOC in size.

I will write a more thourough readme on release.
